# Project 2: Sorting Hat Quiz (Harry Potter)

## Overview

A quiz emulating the sorting hat from Harry Potter. 
The time frame for this pair coding project was 48 hours.
The main game logic was completed in this time. I used the following weekend to complete the result feature (alternating result house crest images and info depending on result), and styling.

## Deployment

The website is deployed on netlify and can be found [here](https://harry-potter-sorting-hat.netlify.app/)

## Built With

## Brief

Consume a public API - this could be anything but it must make sense for your project.
Have several components - At least one classical and one functional.
The app can have a router - with several "pages", this is up to your digression and if it makes sense for your project.
Include wireframes - that you designed before building the app.
Be deployed online and accesbile to the public.

## Quiz

This quiz offers 4 sets of 4 multiple choice questions. The result of the quiz is dependent on the choices made by the user. This result will be one of the 4 Hogwarts houses, (Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, Slytherin).

## Credits

...

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
